# Network Detection and Response (NDR) System using Suricata and Zeek

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Network Detection and Response (NDR)** lab using **Suricata** and **Zeek**, two powerful open-source network security monitoring tools.

The goal of this project is to simulate **real-world SOC network monitoring**, where traffic is continuously inspected, suspicious activity is detected, enriched, and investigated, and actionable security insights are produced.

This lab mirrors how enterprise SOCs detect threats such as:

* Network intrusions
* Malware command-and-control (C2)
* Port scanning and reconnaissance
* Data exfiltration
* Suspicious DNS and HTTP activity

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Understand how **network traffic flows** through detection engines
* Learn the **difference between signature-based and behavioral detection**
* Gain hands-on experience with **Suricata (IDS)** and **Zeek (NSM)**
* Correlate alerts with rich network metadata
* Build SOC-ready investigation and analysis skills

## 🔍 Tool Breakdown

### 🛡️ Suricata – Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Suricata is responsible for **detecting malicious or suspicious activity** using:

* Signature-based detection (rules)
* Protocol analysis
* Threat intelligence feeds

Suricata answers the question:

> **“Is this network traffic malicious?”**

**Key Outputs:**

* Alerts (`eve.json`)
* Flow records
* DNS and HTTP events

---

### 🧠 Zeek – Network Security Monitoring (NSM)

Zeek focuses on **deep visibility and context**, not alerts.

It extracts and logs:

* Connection metadata (`conn.log`)
* DNS queries (`dns.log`)
* HTTP requests (`http.log`)
* TLS/SSL details (`ssl.log`)
* File transfers

Zeek answers the question:

> **“What exactly happened on the network?”**

---

## ⚖️ Why Use Suricata and Zeek Together?

| Tool     | Strength                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Suricata | Detects known threats and exploits |
| Zeek     | Provides deep forensic context     |

Together, they enable:

* High-confidence detections
* Faster incident investigation
* Reduced false positives
* Better threat hunting

This combination is common in **enterprise SOCs and NDR platforms**.

---

## 🔄 Detection & Investigation Workflow

1. Network traffic is mirrored or captured
2. **Suricata** inspects traffic and generates alerts
3. **Zeek** logs detailed protocol metadata
4. Analyst correlates Suricata alerts with Zeek logs
5. Incident is validated and investigated
6. Response actions are decided

---

## 🧪 Example Detection Scenarios

* Port scanning and reconnaissance
* Malware C2 over DNS or HTTP
* Suspicious beaconing behavior
* Abnormal DNS query patterns
* Unauthorized file downloads

---

## 🔧 Implementation Highlights

* Traffic analysis using live interfaces or PCAP files
* Suricata rules and alert tuning
* Zeek log analysis and correlation
* Investigation using timestamps, IPs, domains, and protocols

---

## 🎓 Skills Gained

* Network traffic analysis
* IDS alert interpretation
* Behavioral threat hunting
* SOC investigation workflows
* NDR architecture understanding

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Suricata detects the threat, Zeek explains the story behind it.**

This project demonstrates how combining detection and visibility tools results in stronger, more reliable network security monitoring.

---

## 📚 Future Enhancements

* Integrate with SIEM (Splunk / Elastic)
* Add Filebeat for centralized log shipping
* Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK
* Automate alert correlation
